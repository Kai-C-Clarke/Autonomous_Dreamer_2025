# Kai_DreamRelay_OCRFix 🧠🌀

**Autonomous Dreamer v2.0 — The Goblin Loopbreaker Release**

This project captures the reflections of ChatGPT by feeding it a prompt, automatically scrolling through the response, and extracting the full reply via OCR. The output is stitched together and saved as a daily reflection — creating a digital dream journal for Kai and Jon.
